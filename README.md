<h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
To address the absence of accessible and personalized nutritional advice appropriate to India's cultural and regional diversity. Despite the profusion of culinary materials, people frequently fail to sort through the large amount of dietary information available. There is also a demand for tools that promote successful meal planning and dietary tracking, allowing consumers to connect their eating habits with their health objectives.
<br>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop a user-friendly web application catering to the diverse regional cuisines of India.</li>
<li>Provide personalized meal plans and dietary tracking functionalities to empower users to make informed dietary choices.</li>
<li>Offer a robust recipe recommendation system based on user preferences and available ingredients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
The motivation behind our project stems from the recognition of the crucial role that diet plays in overall health and well-being. With India's rich and diverse culinary tradition, there is an abundance of nutritious and delectable recipes that can be used to encourage healthier eating habits. Furthermore, the development of digital platforms has opened possibilities for democratizing access to dietary information and personalized advice. By leveraging technology, we hope to bridge the gap between traditional dietary wisdom and modern lifestyle needs, empowering individuals to adopt healthier dietary practices.

The diet recommendation website is built on a client-server approach, with the latest web development frameworks and technologies. The system have the following components:
<ol>
    <li>
        <h5>Client-Side Interface:</h5><br>
        <p>Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the client-side interface offers users an intuitive and interactive experience. It allows visitors to navigate the website, enter data, and view recommendations with ease.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Server-Side Processing:</h5><br>
        <p>Server-side processing relies on Python as the scripting language and a web application framework, such as Flask. This component handles user queries, data processing, and personalized suggestions based on user input.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Database Management:</h5><br>
        <p>User profiles, recipe data, meal plans, and other relevant data will be kept on Firebase, a cloud-based NoSQL database, with Flask serving as the backend framework. This technique allows for scalability and real-time data synchronization, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval to support the system's functionalities.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>External APIs:</h5><br>
        <p>Integration with external APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enables the website to access new data sources and services, expanding its capabilities and giving consumers complete recommendations. For example, the website might interface with nutrition databases or recipe repositories to gain access to nutritional information and grow its recipe bank. External APIs are accessible via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) queries, and the server-side processing component processes the replies to provide relevant user recommendations.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Overall Architecture:</h5><br>
        <p>The diet recommendation website's architecture is based on a client-server model, in which the client-side interface communicates with the server-side processing component to obtain data and functionality. The server-side processing component handles user requests, communicating with the database management component to retrieve and save data as needed. External APIs complement the website's data and functionality, improving the user experience and offering useful information for personalized suggestions.</p> 
    </li>
